# Privacy Policy

Tl, DR: The project hosted on Github, created by Shibzel, does not collect any sensitive or personal data, such as messages or private information. Only the necessary data that is required for the proper functioning of the bot, such as the user's account ID, tag, and parameters, may be collected and stored.

## Data Usage

The data collected by the project is solely used for the purpose of enabling the bot to function as intended. This data is not shared with any third parties, and it is not used for any other purposes, such as marketing or advertising.

## Data Protection

The project is hosted on a private Virtual Private Server (VPS) to ensure the security and privacy of user data. Only Shibzel has direct access to the data stored on the VPS, and appropriate measures are taken to protect the data from unauthorized access.

## Data Retention

The majority of data collected by the project is retained only temporarily for the duration of the user's interaction with the bot, and is promptly deleted and removed from the system once the intended purpose is fulfilled. However, some data may be stored permanently for the legitimate purpose of the bot's functioning.

By using the product, users acknowledge and accept that while most of the data collected is retained temporarily, some data may be stored permanently in the system for the intended purpose of the bot's functioning. Users are encouraged to avoid providing any sensitive or personal information through the bot, as the data may be stored permanently in the system.

Shibzel shall not be held responsible for any data retention or storage beyond the intended purpose of the bot's functioning, and users should exercise caution when interacting with the bot and providing any information.

## Third-Party Services

The project may integrate with third-party services, such as APIs or libraries, for certain functionalities. Users are advised to review the privacy policies of these third-party services, as they may have their own data collection and usage practices.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

Shibzel reserves the right to modify or update this privacy policy at any time. Users are encouraged to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes. By continuing to use the project, users signify their acceptance of any changes to the privacy policy.
