# Features

### Moderation

Shibbot will help you moderate your server(s) efficiently : it has all the classics moderation commands (there is a lot of them, really), such as `kick`, `tempmute`, `ban`, you know, the basic ones.
But it also has less popular ones : `nuke` (kadaboom haha), `multikick`, `softban` to more flexibility while you sanction a member (abusively or not haha, we don't care).

**Memes :**

Get the hotest memes from Reddit everyday with the `meme` (or `nmeme` for nsfw content) command, the bot scraps memes everyday to Reddit.

**Images :**

Want to "awwww" in front of cute animals pictues with your friends (if you have some) ? Then the bot has shibes, cats, birds just for your needs !

**What's that ?**

There is some wierd commands, like `piss` or `twitter`, we have absolutely no ideas why they exists neither what they do. Maybe you should try them out or not...

# About this repository

## Motivation

Idk I just wanted to make a Discord bot for myself and the others

## Host and code

Please don't host yourself the bot, a lot of features will soon depend on the database, it is preferable to invite it by using the link right above.

Of, course you can inspire your code on mine, I didn't said that this is the best idea but I think that my code isn't bad at all (I hope so).
